# LILA

The Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA) are 4-8ha experimental wetlands that mimic the ridge-slough landscape of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem.  This repository was created to store R code files that were used while Nathan J. Dorn's Lab was undercontract with the South Florida Watermanagment District to conduct research in LILA. The main project was the "Stage Contrast Study" where wet season water depths were manipulated to be shallower in two of the wetlands (i.e., constrained), while the others were followed the more natural rainfall dominated wet season water depths. As part of the Stage Contrast Study, the aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate communities were sampled using a combination of throw traps, trap netting (i.e., fyke and hoop), and Apple Snail Egg Clutch Surveys.  The contract also included in the same wetlands a projects dedicated to a large macroinvertebrates of conservation concern (i.e., the Florida Apple Snail and Crayfish) which included mesocosm experiments and tethering.
